# Microservices Architecture

This directory will contain the microservices implementation of the monolith application.

## Planned Microservices

### Core Services
- **Orders Service**: Order management and processing
- **Products Service**: Product catalog and inventory
- **Users Service**: User management and authentication
- **Notifications Service**: Email and notification handling

### Supporting Services
- **API Gateway**: Request routing and load balancing
- **Service Discovery**: Service registration and discovery
- **Configuration Service**: Centralized configuration management

## Architecture Goals

- **Independent Deployability**: Each service can be deployed independently
- **Technology Diversity**: Services can use different technologies
- **Scalability**: Individual services can be scaled based on demand
- **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one service doesn't affect others

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Extract Orders Service from monolith
2. **Phase 2**: Extract Products Service
3. **Phase 3**: Add API Gateway
4. **Phase 4**: Implement service discovery
5. **Phase 5**: Add monitoring and observability

## Technology Stack

- **.NET 8**: Core application framework
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **Docker Compose**: Local orchestration
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection
- **Grafana**: Monitoring and visualization
- **k6**: Load testing

## Getting Started

When microservices are implemented, you'll be able to run:

```bash
# Start microservices architecture
docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml up --build

# Run load tests against microservices
cd shared/load-testing
k6 run k6-microservices-script.js
```

## Monitoring

The microservices will share the same monitoring infrastructure:
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection from all services
- **Grafana**: Unified dashboards for all services
- **Distributed Tracing**: Request flow across services
- **Service Mesh**: Communication monitoring
